INSTRUCTIONS:
Write a Markdown document with EXACTLY the following 11 sections, in this order.
Use `## Section Name` as the heading for each.  Do not add extra sections.
Do not skip any section — if information is unavailable, write a brief note saying so.

1. ## Context
   (What project is this? What is the branch for? What was the developer working on?)

2. ## What Changed
   (Enumerate files and high-level changes that are uncommitted or recently committed)

3. ## Why
   (Based on commit messages and issue links, explain the rationale for the changes)

4. ## Current Implementation
   (Describe the current code structure and what has actually been implemented so far)

5. ## Known Problems
   (Failing tests, bugs mentioned in TODOs/issues, documentation drift issues)

6. ## Unfinished Work
   (What was in-progress and not yet completed? TODOs, open PRs, half-finished logic)

7. ## Key Files
   (List the most important files an incoming developer must read first, with 1-line descriptions)

8. ## Dependencies
   (Key libraries, services, or external systems this code depends on)

9. ## Tests to Run
   (Exact commands to run the test suite, and which tests are most critical to watch)

10. ## Risks
    (What could break? What assumptions are fragile? What has no test coverage?)

11. ## Recommended Next Actions
    (Ranked list from highest to lowest priority/risk — what should the new developer do first?)

Write clearly for a developer who has never seen this codebase before.
Be specific and concrete — reference actual file names, function names, and issue numbers where available.
